Changes in Version 1.0-3

  o Depends/Imports has been streamlined. Only zoo and strucchange are
    in Depends now. R (>= 2.14.0) is now required.

  o The vignettes have been moved from inst/doc/ to vignettes/ in the
    source package.
    
  o Only car::linearHypothesis() is employed in "fxregime" now. The old
    car::linear.hypothesis() has been deprecated for a while and is now
    not longer supported by fxpegtest().
  

Changes in Version 1.0-2

  o Fixed lines() method for "fxregimes" objects.

  o Recompressed data sets in package to reduce file storage requirements.
  
  o Some technical changes for new R 2.14.0, e.g., adding Authors@R in
    DESCRIPTION, recompressing data, etc.


Changes in Version 1.0-1

  o Modified fxpegtest() to use linearHypothesis() instead of
    linear.hypothesis() in case car 2.0-0 or greater is installed.


Changes in Version 1.0-0

  o Release to accompany forthcoming publication of the methodology
    in Computational Statistics & Data Analysis.
    doi:10.1016/j.csda.2009.12.005

  o Updated version of FXRatesCHF data: continued until 2010-02-12 
    (previous version 2009-08-14).

  o Added optional high performance computing support by means of the
    "foreach" package for the fxregime() function. This can
    be leveraged to alleviate the computational burden in the dynamic
    programming approach. Simply register a parallel backend (e.g.,
    by means of "doMC" or "doSNOW") and call fxregime() with
    additional argument hpc = "foreach".
    

Changes in Version 0.3-1

  o enhanced documentation for new Rd parser.


Changes in Version 0.3-0

  o Updated version of FXRatesCHF data: The data continues until
    2009-08-14 (only 2008-01-04 in the previous version).
    The column VEB was renamed to the new VEF to reflect that
    Venezuela went from the old bolivar to the bolivar forte
    (divided by 1000 due to inflation).    
    
  o The "CNY" vignette was updated/extended to the new data.


Changes in Version 0.2-1

  o removed \itemize in .Rd files for new R-devel.


Changes in Version 0.2-0

  o Added a confint() method for "fxregimes" objects. For this,
    a bread() method for "fxlm" objects was added and the results
    of the estfun() method were rescaled.   

  o Second CRAN version of the "fxregime" package, accompanying
    Report 70, http://epub.wu-wien.ac.at/. This is an updated
    version of Report 56, using an extended data period and
    slightly modified currency baskets but leading to qualitatively
    similar results.
    
  o The vignettes for CNY and INR have been updated to reproduce
    Report 70, rather than 56.


Changes in Version 0.1-0

  o First CRAN version of the "fxregime" package, accompanying
    Report 56, http://epub.wu-wien.ac.at/.


Changes in version 0.0-1

  o first Version of the package
