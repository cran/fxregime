Changes in Version 0.3-0

  o Updated version of FXRatesCHF data: The data continues until
    2009-08-14 (only 2008-01-04 in the previous version).
    The column VEB was renamed to the new VEF to reflect that
    Venezuela went from the old bolivar to the bolivar forte
    (divided by 1000 due to inflation).    
    
  o The "CNY" vignette was updated/extended to the new data.

Changes in Version 0.2-0

  o Added a confint() method for "fxregimes" objects. For this,
    a bread() method for "fxlm" objects was added and the results
    of the estfun() method were rescaled.   

  o Second CRAN version of the "fxregime" package, accompanying
    Report 70, http://epub.wu-wien.ac.at/. This is an updated
    version of Report 56, using an extended data period and
    slightly modified currency baskets but leading to qualitatively
    similar results.
    
  o The vignettes for CNY and INR have been updated to reproduce
    Report 70, rather than 56.
