Changes in Version 0.2-0

  o Added a confint() method for "fxregimes" objects. For this,
    a bread() method for "fxlm" objects was added and the results
    of the estfun() method were rescaled.   

  o Second CRAN version of the "fxregime" package, accompanying
    Report 70, http://epub.wu-wien.ac.at/. This is an updated
    version of Report 56, using an extended data period and
    slightly modified currency baskets but leading to qualitatively
    similar results.
    
  o The vignettes for CNY and INR have been updated to reproduce
    Report 70, rather than 56.
